# The default password ageing policy can be specified in either days

# or MINWEEKS the shadow(5) database is updated using units of days.
# It is an error to set both the WEEKS and the DAYS variant for a
# given MIN/MAX/WARN variable.
# The MIN and WARN policies are only active if a MAX policy is also set.

# HISTORY sets the number of prior password changes to keep and
# check for a user when changing passwords.  Setting the HISTORY
# value to zero (0), or removing/commenting out the flag will

# be checked if the flag is not present or has zero value.
# The maximum value of HISTORY is 26.

# This flag is only enforced for user accounts defined in the
